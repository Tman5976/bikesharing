## Overview of Project

This challenge asked us to work with Tableau to create different visualized charts. The charts will be used to communicate data gathered from a Citibike program in New York City.
The goal is to create a story to present to potential investors to stir interest in a similar program in Des Moines.

## Results
Graph 1
The first graph shows where the bike stations that have the highest number of trips started. The larger and darker the circle, the more trips began.

Graph 2
This graph displays the number of trips taken throughout the week based on the time of the day. The chart shows cells depicting an hour-long window during a specific day. The blue represents a low number of rides, and the red shows the highest number.

We can see that Thursday from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. sees the highest number of trips during the week. While Saturday has the most consistent rider count throughout the day.

Graph 3
This chart shows the exact breakdown as the Trips by Weekday with an added filter based on gender.
The gender filter shows a similar breakdown of the most populated days and hours of the week.

This data does give us our first look at the difference in users based on gender. From this, we can see those male riders are more prevalent than female riders.

Graph 4
The above graph gives us a breakdown of how long each trip lasted. The data is filtered with hours and minutes of each recorded trip. The data only included trips of less than one hour to two hours because there was a lack of data for trips lasting longer than two hours.

We can see the majority of trips last fewer than ten minutesâ€”trips peak between five and six minutes with a combined 292,000 trips.

Graph 5
Much like Trips by Weekday and Trips by Gender, this chart communicates the total trip duration with an added gender filter. Again, we see the trip duration remains consistent across genders, but male riders are taking the most trips.

Graph 6
This graph shows us how many bike users are one-time customers or subscribers. The single-use riders are blue, and subscribers are orange.

Subscribers make up the majority of users recording trips, with 81% of trips taken by subscribers.

Graph 7
The final graph shows the breakdown of user types filtered by weekday and gender.

The results from this graph are consistent with our previous conclusions;
- There are considerably more subscribers than users.
- Thursday sees the highest number of traffic.
- Males are taking the most trips.

## Summary
After examining the different graphs, there are a few recommendations for our bike-sharing program in Des Moines.

Bike-sharing stations need to be close enough to limit trips to less than ten minutes. There is a considerable dropoff of trips that last longer than ten minutes from our Ney York data. If potential riders have easy access to stations in the city, they will be more likely to use the bikes.

The stations also need to be ready for peak demand between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., especially on Thursdays. A couple of the graphs showed that those hours saw the highest level of trips taken. The bike-sharing program needs to be prepared to handle 

I would suggest an additional graph finding out what buildings are by the busiest starting stations for trips. It would be essential to know if there are consistent places that get more people to start trips. Classrooms, coffee shops, restaurants are all possible hot spots. Knowing what to look at when deciding where to put stations is crucial.

A breakdown of the age of riders would also be beneficial for the program. Knowing what age group is most likely to take part in the bike-sharing program would influence how we advertise the program.
